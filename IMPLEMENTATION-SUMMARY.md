# Sofia Dental Calendar - Implementation Summary

## What Has Been Implemented

### ‚úÖ Successfully Deployed to elosofia.site

1. **GitHub Pages Static Hosting**
   - Calendar interface accessible at https://elosofia.site
   - All static assets (HTML, CSS, JS) served from GitHub
   - Automatic deployment on push to master branch

2. **Backend Services via ngrok**
   - Calendar API: https://0ac90f1eb152.ngrok-free.app/api/*
   - Real-time updates via WebSocket
   - All CRUD operations for appointments working

3. **Docker Services Running**
   - dental-calendar: Calendar API and Socket.IO server
   - livekit: WebRTC server for voice
   - sofia-agent: AI voice assistant with Gemini
   - crm-dashboard: Customer management
   - sofia-web: Additional web interface

4. **Configuration Management**
   - Dynamic config.js detects environment (local vs production)
   - Automatic URL switching based on hostname
   - ngrok URLs configured for external access

## Current Limitations

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Voice Features (Sofia AI)
- **Issue**: WebRTC media streams cannot traverse ngrok HTTP proxy
- **Symptom**: "Could not establish pc connection" error
- **Status**: Signaling works but audio/video streams fail
- **Workaround**: Voice features only work locally, not through elosofia.site

### üîß ngrok Limitations
- Free tier URLs change on restart
- Requires manual config update when URL changes
- Connection limits on free tier
- No UDP support (needed for optimal WebRTC)

## How to Access

1. **Calendar Interface**: https://elosofia.site
   - View appointments
   - Add/edit/delete appointments
   - Real-time updates work

2. **Local Voice Testing**: http://localhost:3005
   - Sofia voice assistant works here
   - Full WebRTC connectivity

## Production Recommendations

To enable full functionality including voice on elosofia.site:

1. **Option A: Cloud Deployment**
   ```
   Deploy to AWS/GCP/Azure with:
   - Public IP addresses
   - Proper SSL certificates
   - TURN server for WebRTC
   ```

2. **Option B: Cloudflare Tunnel**
   ```
   Use Cloudflare's free tunnel service:
   - Supports WebRTC
   - Stable URLs
   - Better performance
   ```

3. **Option C: VPS with Domain**
   ```
   - Get a VPS (DigitalOcean, Linode, etc.)
   - Point elosofia.site directly to VPS
   - Install services with Docker
   - Configure nginx reverse proxy
   ```

## Quick Test Commands

```bash
# Test calendar API
curl https://0ac90f1eb152.ngrok-free.app/api/appointments

# Check Docker status
docker-compose ps

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f dental-calendar

# Restart services
docker-compose restart
```

## Summary

‚úÖ **Working**: Calendar functionality, appointment management, real-time updates
‚ö†Ô∏è **Limited**: Voice features (local only due to WebRTC/ngrok incompatibility)
üìù **Next Steps**: Deploy to proper hosting for full voice support

The system is successfully deployed to elosofia.site with the calendar features fully functional. Voice features require proper hosting infrastructure to work over the internet.
