# üÜì Free Solutions for 24/7 Home Server with WebRTC

## üéØ Your Requirements:
- No monthly costs
- Work with current Vodafone connection
- No router access needed
- Support WebRTC (voice/video)
- Reliable for demos

## üí° Free Solutions That Actually Work:

### 1. **Cloudflare Tunnel + TCP-Only WebRTC** ‚úÖ (Recommended)
Your current setup can work with small modifications:

```javascript
// Force LiveKit to use TCP only (in your connection code)
const room = new Room({
  rtcConfig: {
    iceTransportPolicy: 'relay',
    iceServers: [{
      urls: 'turn:YOUR_IP:3478?transport=tcp',
      username: 'test',
      credential: 'test'
    }]
  }
});
```

**Pros:**
- Uses your existing Cloudflare tunnel
- No additional setup
- Works through any firewall

**Cons:**
- Slightly higher latency
- Requires TURN server configuration

### 2. **GitHub Codespaces Tunnel** üöÄ (Clever Hack)
Use GitHub's free tier as a tunnel:

```bash
# Install GitHub CLI
curl -fsSL https://cli.github.com/packages/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg | sudo dd of=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg] https://cli.github.com/packages stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/github-cli.list > /dev/null
sudo apt update && sudo apt install gh

# Login and forward ports
gh auth login
gh codespace ports forward 3005:3005 7880:7880
```

**Pros:**
- Completely free (60 hours/month)
- Reliable Microsoft infrastructure
- Supports multiple ports

### 3. **Tailscale Funnel** üåê (Best ngrok Alternative)
Better than ngrok for WebRTC:

```bash
# Install
curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh

# Setup funnel (public access)
sudo tailscale up
tailscale funnel 3005
tailscale funnel 7880
```

**Pros:**
- Free for personal use
- Better protocol support than ngrok
- Built-in SSL

### 4. **Tor Hidden Service** üßÖ (Anonymous Option)
Not ideal for WebRTC but works for API:

```bash
# Install Tor
sudo apt install tor

# Configure hidden service
sudo nano /etc/tor/torrc
# Add:
HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/hidden_service/
HiddenServicePort 3005 127.0.0.1:3005
HiddenServicePort 7880 127.0.0.1:7880
```

**Pros:**
- Completely anonymous
- No port forwarding needed
- Free forever

**Cons:**
- High latency
- .onion addresses

### 5. **IPv6 + Free Dynamic DNS** üåç (Direct Access)
Your connection already has public IPv6!

```bash
# Register free at freedns.afraid.org or duckdns.org
# Update script:
curl "https://freedns.afraid.org/dynamic/update.php?YOUR_UPDATE_KEY"

# Access via:
https://yourname.mooo.com (IPv6 resolved)
```

**Pros:**
- Direct connection, no tunnels
- Low latency
- Future-proof

**Cons:**
- Only works for IPv6-enabled clients

### 6. **Mesh VPN Networks** üîó (P2P Solution)

**ZeroTier** (Recommended):
```bash
curl -s https://install.zerotier.com | sudo bash
sudo zerotier-cli join 9f77fc393e  # Public Earth network
```

**Yggdrasil Network**:
```bash
# Provides public IPv6 addresses
sudo apt install yggdrasil
sudo systemctl enable --now yggdrasil
```

**Pros:**
- Creates virtual public IPs
- Works behind any NAT
- P2P, no central server

### 7. **Free Oracle Cloud VPS** ‚òÅÔ∏è (Permanent Free)
Oracle offers always-free tier:

- 2 AMD VMs or 4 ARM VMs
- 24GB RAM total
- 200GB storage
- No credit card charges

Sign up at: cloud.oracle.com

**Use as:**
- Full server (move everything there)
- Or just as reverse proxy

## üõ†Ô∏è Immediate Action Plan:

### Step 1: TCP-Only WebRTC (Today)
Modify your LiveKit configuration:

```yaml
# livekit.yaml
rtc:
  use_ice_lite: true
  tcp_port: 7881
  port_range_start: 0  # Disable UDP
  port_range_end: 0
```

### Step 2: Better Tunneling (This Week)
1. Try Tailscale Funnel first
2. Or GitHub Codespaces tunnel
3. Both are better than ngrok for your use case

### Step 3: Long-term (Next Month)
When getting new internet, look for:

- **Business plans** with:
  - Static IP included
  - No port blocking
  - Higher upload speeds
  - SLA guarantees

- **Fiber providers** that offer:
  - Symmetric speeds
  - Static IP options
  - Port forwarding allowed
  - No CGNAT

- **Specific German ISPs good for servers**:
  - **1&1**: Offers static IP for ‚Ç¨5/month
  - **Deutsche Telekom**: Business plans
  - **Vodafone Business**: Different from residential
  - **Local fiber providers**: Often more flexible

## üì± Router Workarounds:

### Try Default Passwords:
Common Vodafone router passwords:
- Admin/admin
- Admin/password
- vodafone/vodafone
- On router label

### Social Engineering:
- "I work from home and need ports for VPN"
- "My employer requires specific ports"
- Ask for "Bridge Mode" (turns router into modem)

## üéÆ Gaming Console Trick:
Tell Vodafone support:
"My PlayStation/Xbox online gaming needs port forwarding"
(They often help gamers with ports)

## ‚úÖ Recommended Combo for Now:

1. **Tailscale Funnel** for HTTP/WebSocket
2. **Force TCP-only** WebRTC
3. **IPv6** as backup option
4. **Oracle Free VPS** as future upgrade

This gives you:
- Zero monthly cost
- Works today
- Reliable enough for demos
- Upgrade path ready

---

**Bottom line**: You can make it work for free, but expect some latency with TCP-only WebRTC. Perfect for demos, then upgrade to better connection later.
