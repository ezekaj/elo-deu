# üöÄ Quick Fix for Investor Demo

## Current Status:
- ‚úÖ Website loads at https://elosofia.site
- ‚úÖ All services running locally
- ‚ö†Ô∏è API routing through Cloudflare needs configuration

## For Investor Demo:

### Option 1: Local Demo (Recommended)
Show the demo on YOUR computer using:
- **URL**: http://localhost:3005
- Everything works perfectly locally
- No routing issues

### Option 2: Screen Share
- Use Zoom/Teams/Google Meet
- Share your screen showing localhost:3005
- Full functionality guaranteed

### Option 3: Quick Global Fix
If you absolutely need global access for investors to try themselves:

1. Use ngrok for a temporary demo:
```bash
ngrok http 3005
```

2. Share the ngrok URL with investors
3. This bypasses the Cloudflare routing issue

## Why This Happened:
The Cloudflare tunnel is serving static files correctly but not proxying API requests properly. This is a configuration issue that can be fixed later.

## What Works Now:
- ‚úÖ All Docker services running
- ‚úÖ Voice assistant functional
- ‚úÖ Calendar integration working
- ‚úÖ Real-time updates active
- ‚úÖ CRM dashboard operational

## Demo Script:
"Let me show you Sofia running on our development server. In production, this would be deployed with proper domain routing, but for this demo, you'll see the full functionality..."

[Proceed with demo on localhost]

The technology is solid - this is just a routing configuration that needs adjustment for production deployment.
