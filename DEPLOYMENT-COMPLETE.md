# 🎉 Sofia Dental AI - Deployed to elosofia.site

## ✅ Deployment Status

Your Sofia Dental AI is now LIVE and globally accessible!

### 🌐 Live URLs
- **Main Site**: https://elosofia.site
- **Calendar API**: https://bulgaria-editorials-several-rack.trycloudflare.com
- **Voice Service**: https://laboratories-israel-focusing-airport.trycloudflare.com

### 📊 Current Status
- ✅ Frontend deployed on GitHub Pages
- ✅ Domain configured (elosofia.site)
- ✅ Voice service running (LiveKit via Cloudflare tunnel)
- ✅ Cloudflare tunnels active

### 🚀 How It Works
1. **Frontend** (GitHub Pages):
   - Static files served from GitHub
   - Custom domain: elosofia.site
   - Automatically updated when you push to GitHub

2. **Backend** (Your Machine):
   - Calendar API on port 3005 → Cloudflare tunnel
   - LiveKit voice on port 7880 → Cloudflare tunnel
   - Must keep tunnels running for backend to work

### 🔧 Maintenance Commands

**Check Status:**
```bash
./check-status.sh
```

**Keep Services Running:**
```bash
./keep-running.sh
```

**Verify Deployment:**
```bash
./verify-deployment.sh
```

### ⚠️ Important Notes
1. **Keep Terminal Open**: The backend services need to stay running
2. **Tunnels**: Free Cloudflare tunnels may change URLs if restarted
3. **Updates**: Push to GitHub to update the frontend

### 🆘 Troubleshooting
- If voice doesn't work: Check LiveKit is running with `docker ps`
- If API fails: Start calendar server with `cd dental-calendar && npm start`
- If tunnels die: Restart with `./keep-running.sh`

### 📱 Test Your Site
