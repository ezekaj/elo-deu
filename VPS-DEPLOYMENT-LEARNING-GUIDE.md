# VPS Deployment Learning Guide for Elosofia.site

## üéØ What We're Trying to Achieve
Deploy your dental calendar web app to a VPS so it's accessible at https://elosofia.site

## üìö Core Concepts You Need to Understand

### 1. **VPS (Virtual Private Server)**
- Think of it as your own computer in the cloud
- You have root access (like administrator on Windows)
- IP address: 167.235.67.1 (your server's address on the internet)

### 2. **DNS (Domain Name System)**
- Translates elosofia.site ‚Üí 167.235.67.1
- Like a phone book for the internet
- A Record: Points domain directly to IP address

### 3. **Web Server (Nginx)**
- Software that handles HTTP requests
- Acts as a "receptionist" directing visitors to the right service
- Listens on ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS)

### 4. **Application Server**
- Your actual app (dental calendar)
- Runs on port 3005
- Nginx forwards requests to it

### 5. **SSL/HTTPS**
- Secure connection (the padlock in browser)
- Certbot gets free certificates from Let's Encrypt

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

```
[User Browser] ‚Üí [elosofia.site DNS] ‚Üí [167.235.67.1]
                                              ‚Üì
                                          [Nginx:80/443]
                                              ‚Üì
                                    [Your App:3005]
```

## üõ†Ô∏è What Actually Happened in Your Deployment

### Step 1: DNS Setup
- You added A records in Namecheap
- elosofia.site ‚Üí 167.235.67.1
- www.elosofia.site ‚Üí 167.235.67.1

### Step 2: Server Access
```bash
ssh root@167.235.67.1  # Connect to your server
```

### Step 3: Code Deployment
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ezekaj/elo-deu.git  # Get your code
cd elo-deu
```

### Step 4: Web Server Setup
```bash
# Nginx configuration created at /etc/nginx/sites-available/elosofia.site
# It forwards requests to your app on port 3005
```

### Step 5: Start Application
```bash
cd dental-calendar/public
python3 -m http.server 3005  # Simple server for static files
```

### Step 6: SSL Certificate
```bash
certbot --nginx -d elosofia.site  # Get HTTPS certificate
```

## üîç Current Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Config Files
- App looking for old ngrok URLs
- Solution: Update all config.js files to use elosofia.site

### Issue 2: API Endpoints
- App expects /api/appointments endpoint
- Solution: Either create mock responses or run full backend

### Issue 3: Service Management
- Python server stops when SSH disconnects
- Solution: Use process manager like PM2 or systemd

## üìñ Learning Path

### Week 1: Basics
- [ ] Watch VPS and DNS videos
- [ ] Practice SSH commands
- [ ] Understand file navigation in Linux

### Week 2: Web Servers
- [ ] Learn Nginx basics
- [ ] Understand reverse proxy concept
- [ ] Practice domain configuration

### Week 3: Application Deployment
- [ ] Learn about process managers (PM2, systemd)
- [ ] Understand environment variables
- [ ] Practice Git on server

### Week 4: Docker (Optional but Recommended)
- [ ] Docker basics
- [ ] Docker Compose
- [ ] Container management

## üí° Key Commands Cheat Sheet

```bash
# Connect to VPS
ssh root@167.235.67.1

# Navigate
cd /root/elo-deu       # Go to project
ls -la                 # List files
pwd                    # Current directory

# Check services
ps aux | grep python   # See running processes
netstat -tlnp          # See open ports
docker ps              # See running containers

# Logs
tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log  # Nginx errors
journalctl -u nginx    # System logs

# Start/Stop
systemctl restart nginx     # Restart nginx
kill [process-id]          # Stop a process
```

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Make it permanent**: Use PM2 or systemd to keep app running
2. **Add backend**: Deploy the actual Node.js backend with API
3. **Monitor**: Set up logging and monitoring
4. **Backup**: Regular backups of code and data
5. **Security**: Firewall rules, fail2ban, SSH keys

## üÜò When You Get Stuck

1. Check logs first
2. Google the exact error message
3. Break problem into smaller parts
4. Test each component separately
5. Ask specific questions on Stack Overflow
